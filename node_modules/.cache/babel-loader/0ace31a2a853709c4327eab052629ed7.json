ODR has the power to\n              change the landscape of the dispute resolution mechanisms, across\n              territories.

From serving as a common source of information,\n              communications tool, global platform for trade and commerce, it\n              has become the engine for introducing modern technological\n              solutions for almost every activity. Needless to say that the\n              Internet has made an impact on many areas of private and public\n              life, one such area being law.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Parallelly, when the world was getting introduced to Internet in\n              the 1960’s and 1970s, the world was also witnessing\n              dissatisfaction with the Court systems all over the world. The\n              caseloads were increasing manifolds with each passing day and much\n              more was expected from the Institution responsible for delivering\n              justice.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <BlogImage\n              src={require(\"../../../assets/images/Pic4.png\")}\n              alt=\"Independent\"\n            />\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              This discontent with the formal Court systems led to the Convening\n              of Pound Conference 1976 where several of the legal stalwarts\n              discussed the current state and the drudgery of the judicial\n              system, not just in terms of efficiency but relating to cost,\n              time, quality of outcome reached, party satisfaction, impact of\n              resolution, interest based needs, creative solutions etc.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Pound Conference has given huge impetus to the growth in\n              popularity to the process of Mediation, which is one of the\n              mechanisms under Alternate Dispute Resolution. Pound Conference\n              pressed for having the mechanisms of Alternate Dispute Resolution\n              (ADR). ADR, though seen as a recently developed mechanism, is an\n              old trick/way of resolving disputes between parties. While Courts\n              are the adversarial form of justice system, ADR aims at resolving\n              the dispute in an amicable manner.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Amongst the processes of ADR i.e. negotiation, mediation and\n              arbitration, negotiation and mediation are the informal processes\n              which aims to settle the matter between two or more disputing\n              parties, and are more driven by needs and satisfaction of parties\n              than their rights and obligation. In negotiation, parties try to\n              discuss their problems and resolve them amongst each other.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Our everyday lives are filled with negotiation, from negotiating\n              for vegetable price to negotiating salaries. The parties realise\n              the cost of dragging a dispute for long and taking it to the\n              court, and understand the benefits of negotiating and reaching a\n              solution that will benefit both parties, thus creating a win-win\n              situation.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <BlogImage\n              src={require(\"../../../assets/images/Pic5.png\")}\n              alt=\"Independent\"\n            />\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              The process of Mediation is facilitated by a third party neutral\n              who assists two or more disputing parties to reach a solution.\n              Mediators does not take sides and their only aim is to resolve the\n              issue. This is again a very real life situation wherein a third\n              person intervenes between two feuding parties and explains to them\n              the long term benefits of ending the dispute and making the\n              parties reach a solution. Several husband wife matrimonial\n              disputes have been resolved by a third party like this, with or\n              without terming it as mediation. The process is entirely\n              voluntary.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              In fact the concept of arbitration, which is very much a formal\n              process like courts, can also be traced back to ancient Greek\n              mythology, wherein an arbitrator was chosen to resolve dispute\n              between two parties through amicable settlement (much like\n              negotiation and mediation). If this didn’t work out then the\n              arbitrator was to adduce evidence of parties, and later on deliver\n              a judgement based on the facts and evidence. This decision could\n              later be appealed against by parties.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Thus, it is very clear that these processes have been part of our\n              systems for very long and the Pound Conference 1976 was\n              instrumental in formally pushing the idea of ADR mechanism, as a\n              respite for parties from the Court systems and lessening the\n              burdens for Courts as well. The Conference was followed by a\n              series of conferences about Alternative Dispute Resolutions.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              The idea of ADR has gained momentum since then throughout the\n              world. ADR was not just an efficient way of resolving disputes, it\n              has also come as a tool to change people’s mindset about disputes\n              and resolving it, by looking at the bigger picture.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              ODR began its existence as Online ADR, an amalgamation of\n              technology and ADR. It is a network based equivalent of offline\n              face-to-face dispute resolution processes like negotiation,\n              mediation and arbitration.[3] The idea of Online Dispute\n              Resolution emerged out of the understanding that disputes will\n              grow as the range of online activities grew. In fact, it was very\n              well understood that the Internet was part of the problem in\n              generating disputes. However, it was also to be part of the\n              solution in garnering resources to resolve it online.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <BlogImage\n              src={require(\"../../../assets/images/Pic6.png\")}\n              alt=\"Independent\"\n            />\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              As already pointed out that the first few years of the internet\n              witnessed few cases. In fact, after the decommissioning of the\n              Internet in 1990 for commercial activity few disputes relating to\n              online commerce began to surface.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              In April, 1994, the first commercial spam occurred when two\n              lawyers tried to recruit clients to participate in an immigration\n              scam.[4] Sometime later, in September, 1994, the U.S. Federal\n              Trade Commission filed its first case of online fraud.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              The case involved an American Online subscriber who advertised\n              that for $99.00 he could show people how to create new credit\n              files at all the major credit bureaus. However the process was not\n              considered to be legal and he had to provide compensation to\n              consumers. There were other instances like this.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Around the same time in 1996, first articles on ODR began to\n              appear in a Law Review[5] and the National Centre for Automated\n              Information Research (NCAIR) sponsored the first ever conference\n              on ODR, which also funded the ODR projects like the Virtual\n              Magistrate, Online Ombuds at University of Massachusetts.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              A year after this Hewlett Foundation established the Centre for\n              Information Technology and Dispute Resolution with the goal of\n              supporting development of the field of ODR by various\n              initiatives.[6] Since then several conferences, seminars around\n              the world have happened with ODR as the central topic.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              A big breakthrough happened in the field of ODR when e-bay founded\n              in 1995 by Pierre Omidyar, put a feedback system where buyers\n              could know more about the seller, in order to generate trust and\n              risk reduction. The feedback was a big step in generating\n              confidence in the buyers and also eliminating disputes between\n              buyers and sellers.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Taking this further, in 1999 e-bay asked University of\n              Massachusetts to conduct a pilot project to mediate disputes\n              between buyers and sellers.[7] The pilot project was a huge\n              success as it handled two hundred disputes in a two week period,\n              by far the largest number of disputes ever handled online till\n              then.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              This prompted e-Bay to include dispute resolution as an option for\n              buyers and sellers in the event a transaction were unsuccessful,\n              making it the first company ever to do this. Initially, eBay’s\n              dispute resolution process was contracted out to an Internet\n              start-up, Square Trade. Square Trade which used new methods like\n              employing web rather than email as means of communication, and\n              also technology supported negotiation before requesting for a\n              mediator.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Several years later the resolution process was taken over by eBay\n              itself. By 2010, the number of disputes handled by eB-ay reached\n              the extraordinary figure of sixty million.[8] According to a BBC\n              report in 2015, e-bay has the most advanced and workable online\n              dispute resolution system that jurisdictions such as Wales and\n              England should adopt to evade the various civil court proceedings.\n              The ODR conference (2016) also ranked e-Bay’s ODR as the largest\n              in the world.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              The methodology used by the company has prevented 90% of the\n              disputes from making it to the courts. It is very clear the e-bay\n              is a trendsetter in the field of Online Dispute Resolution. Not\n              just other companies, but other countries have also taken\n              inspiration from e-bay and understood what a long leap dispute\n              resolution can take with the help of technology\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Some countries such as U.K have somewhere taken inspiration from\n              this and tried to imbibe the ODR systems in their territories, in\n              similar or different formats. United Kingdom has tried to embrace\n              the e-Bay approach, but they have opted to use judges to resolve\n              the conflicts due to the existing laws. It is apparent that such a\n              methodology is expensive and time-consuming, and can be made more\n              dynamic and easy for the users of the ODR system.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              ODR in the current state is also being used as a hybrid mechanism\n              between online and offline by various institutions. E.g. UDRP\n              dispute resolution happened without face to face meetings except\n              sometimes through telephones. Some ODR providers use limited\n              internet. One of the earlier dispute resolution providers\n              eResolution.com employed a completely online system but stopped\n              handling cases in 2001. Currently World Intellectual Property\n              Organisation (“WIPO”) and National Arbitration Forum (“NAF”) have\n              online systems where emails are sometimes used as well.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\", color: \"blue\" }}>\n              FUTURE OF ODR\n            </div>\n            <br />\n            <BlogImage\n              src={require(\"../../../assets/images/Pic7.png\")}\n              alt=\"Independent\"\n            />\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Technology is undergoing a change rapidly. What is the best\n              technology today might get outdated tomorrow. It will become\n              faster and cheaper. There was a time when ADR was introduced and\n              the world took time to adapt to it, and when it did, it realised\n              what power it brought to the whole process of dispute resolution\n              as well as to the parties.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              In ADR parties are in charge of their cases. ODR furthers this\n              power of resolving disputes without putting a pause in one’s life.\n              A party who was once entangled in a case would have innumerable\n              things to worry about, cost, travel, time, attending courts, so\n              much so that the dispute would become central to his/ her\n              existence.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              ODR, in its present form, takes away all the above mentioned\n              hassles. The ongoing pandemic has suddenly made us face a\n              situation where the world would have been lost, if not for\n              technology and Internet. The need for ODR hasn’t been felt\n              more.ODR in future, is believed to be not just an extension of\n              ADR, but bringing in whole different dynamics altogether. ODR\n              tomorrow might not just be about making the technology speedier or\n              less costly but also smarter in data processing.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              If that happens, the trajectory of ODR, popularly known as the\n              “Fourth Party” would be very different from what we fathom today.\n              The wider acceptance of ODR would also mean bringing on board very\n              many pre litigation stage cases where parties are comfortable to\n              get their future disputes resolved. Organizations in the future\n              would be adopting business policies for inclusion of ODR system.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Although online mediation has received criticisms because of its\n              impersonal attribute, in future it will not be perceived so\n              because we are looking at a world where every transaction and\n              communication will be happening online, and that is going to be\n              the normal.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              In future the court may also realise the value addition of ODR as\n              part of the system rather than different from it. In fact,\n              economies might realise the benefits of an ODR system over the\n              current Court system. There will always be a need for Courts to\n              resolve certain kinds of matters but there will also be matters\n              which would not need the adversarial approach of the Courts, and\n              the parties would be happy to resolve it using technology. This\n              balancing act would be great in resolving as much number of\n              disputes as we can.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              [1] Orna Rabinovich-Einy & Ethan Katsh, Digital Justice: Reshaping\n              Boundaries in Online Dispute Resolution Environment, International\n              Journal of Online Dispute Resolution, Eleven international\n              publishing, Vol 1, 2014, pp.6\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              [2] Karolina Mania, Online dispute resolution: The future of\n              justice, International Comparative Jurisprudence, Vol 1 2015,\n              pp76-86\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              [3] Orna Rabinovich-Einy & Ethan Katsh, Digital Justice: Reshaping\n              Boundaries in Online Dispute Resolution Environment, International\n              Journal of Online Dispute Resolution, Eleven international\n              publishing, Vol 1, 2014, pp.7\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              [4] Ethan Katsh, Bringing Online Dispute Resolution to Virtual\n              Worlds: Creating Processes Through Code, New York Law School Law\n              Review, Vol. 49 Issue 1, January 2004, pp 271- 291\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              [5] E.Katsh, “Dispute Resolution in Cyberspace”, 28 Conn.
