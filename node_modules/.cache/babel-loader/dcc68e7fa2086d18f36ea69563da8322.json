ADR methods are typically less expensive\n              and quicker. They are becoming more common in cases that would\n              otherwise go to court, such as high- profile labor disputes,\n              divorce actions, and personal injury proceedings.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              One of the key reasons that parties can favor ADR procedures to\n              adversarial litigation is that, unlike adversarial litigation, ADR\n              procedures are always constructive and allow the parties to\n              consider each other's roles. ADR also encourages the sides to come\n              up with more imaginative options that a judge would not be able to\n              enforce legally.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <SubHeadWrap>\n              Advantages of ADR in women related disputes.\n            </SubHeadWrap>\n            <br />\n            <BlogImage\n              src={require(\"../../../assets/images/Nitika.png\")}\n              alt=\"Independent\"\n            />\n            <br />\n            <SubHeadWrap>Time Efficient</SubHeadWrap>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              The idea that it typically takes much less time to achieve a final\n              settlement than if the lawsuit went to trial is one of the\n              advantages. An individual who is an authority in the subject area\n              may even arbitrate or mediate the parties' conflict. In a typical\n              trial containing complex and technical problems that few people\n              outside of the related industry understand, a significant amount\n              of time must be spent preparing the judge and jury only so they\n              can make an educated decision. However, if the arbitrator has an\n              experience in the subject area, much less time will be wasted on\n              this, and the parties will be able to move on to the substantive\n              problems of the case even faster.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <BlogImage\n              src={require(\"../../../assets/images/Nitika_1.png\")}\n              alt=\"Independent\"\n            />\n            <br />\n            <SubHeadWrap>Money Efficient</SubHeadWrap>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              It often usually (but not always) costs considerably less money.\n              This considerable time commitment often transforms into a\n              significant financial investment.

In various countries, the\n              community leaders involved in informal dispute resolution are\n              overwhelmingly older males, prompting criticism that “social\n              hierarchies and inequalities are often reflected and reinforced”\n              in dispute resolution systems.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              This is especially troublesome if the emphasis on compromise and\n              agreement leads to pressure on weaker parties (in this case,\n              vulnerable women) to accept settlements that do not actually serve\n              their best interests or may prevent them from acquiring their full\n              legal rights.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              While an increasing number of studies show that this is often the\n              case, it is critical to understand the particulars of how\n              different systems operate in different situations – especially for\n              those considering whether or not to support various types of\n              reforms aimed at helping the most vulnerable.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              According to the Mediation Boards Act of 1987 and subsequent\n              amendments, 8 women and men are legally obligated to use these\n              processes to resolve a wide range of civil and criminal disputes,\n              including assault, family disputes (including domestic violence),\n              and more. primarily physical and often sexual violence), land and\n              property disputes, and commercial transaction disputes, and to try\n              to reach voluntary agreements before the cases are brought to a\n              formal court of law.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Mediators seek to get to the \"root cause\" of the dispute and try\n              to promote a mutually agreeable settlement that respects the\n              interests of all disputing parties, according to the\n              interest-based mediation procedure used by mediation boards. In\n              contrast to rights, needs, or power-based approaches to conflict\n              resolution, this method aims to be non-adversarial and\n              collaborative.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <BlogImage\n              src={require(\"../../../assets/images/Nitika_2.png\")}\n              alt=\"Independent\"\n            />\n            <br />\n            <SubHeadWrap>\n              The Potential for Gender Bias Power in Mediation\n            </SubHeadWrap>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              The parties to the mediation must start from equal positions of\n              authority in order for the mediation to be successful. Economic,\n              intellectual, physical, mental, and procedural power are all forms\n              of power. However, many women are stuck in power imbalanced\n              relationships, whether they are family, work-related, or\n              contractual. Mediation in the face of these power imbalances calls\n              into question the claim that mediation allows parties more control\n              and self-determination than conventional lawsuits. The effect of\n              power imbalances on mediation has received the most attention in\n              the context of intimate relationships. The relationship between an\n              abused woman and her abuser, for example, revolves around themes.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              of power and control. The abuser uses a variety of tactics to\n              create and maintain control over his victim throughout their\n              relationship, ranging from isolation and mental and financial\n              abuse to intimidation, coercion, threats, and physical violence.\n              Furthermore, the abuser will regularly blame the victim for his\n              abuse, leading her to think that if she conforms to his\n              expectations, the abuse will cease. In an abusive relationship,\n              the abuser has all of the power: legal, psychological, physical,\n              and mental. It's impossible to expect him to give up that\n              authority during the mediation process. As her abuser glares at\n              her from across the table, the abused woman's concern for her\n              physical safety may prevent her from feeling comfortable\n              mediating.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              The victim may feel pressured to settle or negotiate, believing\n              that if she lowers her demands, the abuse (this time, the abuse\n              associated with the mediation process) will stop. The abuser may\n              change his demands repeatedly during negotiations to show the\n              victim that he still has the authority to shape the agreement, and\n              thus her life, according to his wishes. And here the objective of\n              mediation gets fully destroyed.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <ul style={{ listStyleType: \"square\", paddingLeft: \"40px\" }}>\n              <li>\n                When there is a fear of getting attacked in the process of\n                mediation then what is the significance of it.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                When the victim needs to compromise out of fear then what is the\n                use of this so-called mediation process.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                When the victim doesn’t get the chance to mediate fairly, then\n                how can be this process useful. This is denying the human and\n                natural rights of women.\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n            <br />\n            <SubHeadWrap>Conclusion</SubHeadWrap>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Instead, the aim of mediation is to find areas of agreement\n              between the parties; indignation is seen as unnecessary when the\n              goal is to reach a consensus. However, the start of mediation may\n              be the first time the woman in the mediation has been able to\n              express her displeasure at her husband, her boss, or her\n              adversary. When conventional societal prohibitions on female anger\n              are combined with mediation's devaluation of anger, it's possible\n              that mediators could silence women who are expressing these\n              feelings for the first time, preventing women from achieving their\n              goals through mediation.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Judges are responsible for ensuring that women are treated equally\n              in mediation. First, judges, like all system actors, must be aware\n              of the possibility of gender bias not only in their own courts,\n              but also in the systems to which they refer female litigants. It\n              is critical to receive training on women's issues, particularly\n              the difficulties that mediation can cause for some women.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Alternative dispute resolution (ADR), which promises faster,\n              cheaper, and more empowering interactions with the legal system,\n              is required in a number of situations involving women. Although\n              some women will be able to mediate efficiently, and some men\n              engaged in mediation will be sensitive to the concerns raised in\n              this article, the possibility of gender bias in the media is\n              undoubtedly present. Failure to ensure that mediation not only\n              treats women equally but also meets their specific needs would\n              lead to alienation from alternative dispute resolution and,\n              eventually, the legal system.\n            </p>\n          </Content>\n        </BlogPage>\n      </Header>\n      <Footer />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default OnlineDisputeBlogSeven;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
