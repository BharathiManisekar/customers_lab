Even as some of these cases stay pending for over\n              ten years, judges dispose of only two crores. This is inefficient\n              and ineffective as well. But recognizing a problem requires\n              recognition of its causes. Here are the primary causes that you\n              need to know.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <SubHeadWrap>Low awareness of rights</SubHeadWrap>\n            <br />\n            <p>Two of the ten founding principles of economics are that:</p>\n            <br />\n            <ul style={{ paddingLeft: \"40px\" }}>\n              <li>People respond to incentives, and</li>\n              <li>The government can sometimes improve market outcomes.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              As India advanced socio-economically over the decades, one of the\n              resulting effects was an increased awareness of legal rights\n              entitled to the common individual, allowing many to muster courage\n              to approach courts of law for justice.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              This was further catalysed by legislation set by governments for\n              new rights such as ‘Right to Information’ and ‘Right to\n              Education’. Devices such as Public Interest Litigation further\n              accelerated the ever-developing volume of cases. Consequently,\n              more parties with grievances approached the courts. However, there\n              is still scope of improving awareness in the masses of the several\n              laws that exist.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <BlogImage\n              src={require(\"../../../assets/images/Tackling_1.png\")}\n              alt=\"Independent\"\n            />\n            <br />\n            <SubHeadWrap>Not enough judges and courts.</SubHeadWrap>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              India has 15 judges for every million people. This is one of the\n              world's lowest ratios. Against the high volume of cases, there are\n              not enough judges to take them on efficiently. The Indian\n              judiciary additionally has insufficient resources. With\n              modernization and digitization not having reached pan-India, India\n              needs more courts and more benches.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <BlogImage\n              src={require(\"../../../assets/images/Tackling_2.png\")}\n              alt=\"Independent\"\n            />\n            <br />\n            <SubHeadWrap>Archaic / Vaguely drafted laws</SubHeadWrap>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              Laws typically are subjected to amendments subject to the\n              developments, as well as relying on precedent of cases pertinent\n              to the same. However, there still are certain archaic laws under\n              myriad statutes; some even dating back to the 1880s!\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              In addition, some are also vulnerable to faulty or vague drafting,\n              as well as multiple interpretations by various courts are also\n              reasons for prolonged litigation.

As the\n              adage goes, justice delayed is justice denied, and justice hurried\n              is justice buried.
